tar - an arching utility
options:
    c - create a new archive (.tar)
    x - extract files from archive
    v - verbosely list files processed
    f - following is the archive name
    z - (zip) filter the archive through gzip (.gz - so cz are required in order to create file.tar.gz (.tgz == .tar.gz)
        used both for zipping and unzipping (depend on c or x options)
    j - filter through bzip2 (.bz2, .tar.bz2 == tbz == .tb2)(more time required but more comprresed file is achvied)
        used for both compressing like decompression (depend on c or x options)
    t - (traverse) list files in an archive
